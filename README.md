# WEATHER-APP-NEW


The Weather App is a user-friendly web application that allows you to check the current weather in your location or search for weather information in any city. It offers a straightforward and intuitive interface with two tabs: "Your Weather" and "Search Weather."

1. Your Weather:
   - Grant Location Access: If you select this tab, you can grant the app access to your device's location. This allows the app to show you the weather based on where you are.

2. Search Weather:
   - In this tab, you can search for weather information in a specific city. Just type the city's name in the search input field and click the search button.

3. Loading Screen:
   - While the app is fetching weather data, a loading screen with an animation and a "Loading" message keeps you informed.

4. Weather Information:
   - Once the weather data is retrieved, the app displays:
     - The city name and a flag representing the country.
     - A weather description to let you know the current conditions.
     - A weather icon for a visual representation.
     - The current temperature in the selected location.
     - Three parameter cards with icons:
       - Windspeed, displaying the wind speed.
       - Humidity, showing the humidity percentage.
       - Clouds, indicating the cloudiness level.

JavaScript is used to make the app interactive and handle data retrieval, ensuring you get the latest weather details with ease.![Screenshot (50)](https://github.com/gauravraoj/WEATHER-APP-NEW/assets/96016132/1cdfa201-38af-4472-b8cf-3c530c6f8718)
